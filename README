 HISTORY

  v1.01:
   * Fixed binary patching to interprest a value of 0 as no known
     CRC32/MD5/SHA1. It was in the specs but mistakenly passed over.
  v1.0:
   * Initial release

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 INFORMATION

  Given the already wide-spread use of IPS, one may quickly wonder why I, of
  all people, took it upon myself to create a new patching format. There are
  many reasons, but the most important ones can be summed up as follows:

    + IPS format is limited to 24-bit addressing. This means you cannot
      make an IPS of a file over 16MB. Even with PPF, which uses 32-bit
      addressing, you are still limited to 4GB. As we're seeing more and
      more 8GB+ DVDs, it's only a matter of time until we have a need for
      ISO patches supporting higher addressing.

    + IPS stores no information to verify the file it is being applied to
      is the file it was intended for. Anyone who has ever done a
      translation should appreciate the number of clueless users who
      can't make the patch work with the interleaved, broke-ass ROM they
      got from BIG AL's l33t H4uS of Romhs.

    + I really wanted the experience of developing my own file format for
      once, instead of always reverse-engineering someone else's. I
      wanted to make something I, and possibly others, would actually have
      a use for.

  For the above reasons, I developed what I have named The NINJA Patch
  Formats, a series of patch specifications designed to deal with the above
  issues.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FEATURES

  There are four forms of NINJA patches, all of which share the extension
  ".RUP"  They are identified by the first eight bytes of the file (if you
  are curious about this, you should probably read the specifications).
  These forms include textual and binary patches in both raw and compressed
  forms. Compressed patches use the gzip compression routine. This is the
  only compression used in NINJA formats.

  Textual patches are larger, but they offer the user some extra options,
  namely comments. Any line beginning with "#" is recognized by NINJA as a
  comment and will be ignored. I'm sure you can think of your own uses for
  such.

  NINJA patches also store the CRC32, MD5sum and SHA1 of a source file. This
  means it's virtually impossible to apply a NINJA patch to a file it was
  not designed for. On top of this, it has special support for console
  systems such as Super Nintendo, Sega Megadrive and Nintendo Game Boy for
  working with the many file formats. It can detect whether a ROM needs its
  headers removed, deinterleaving or other problems, so that a patch made
  by NINJA will work on any intended ROM, regardless of its format.

  For example, I make a patch of a Megadrive game I hacked. And end user
  wants to apply it, but their ROM is in SMD (even though some jackass named
  it .BIN). NINJA will detect their SMD ROM, deinterleave it, and apply the
  patch properly, where other tools like IPS or PPF would fail.

  NINJA supports nearly infinite patch sizes and patch lengths. How infinite
  is nearly infinite? Well if you want to work out 2^2040, be my guest, but
  if not, I'll just tell you it's around 600 zeros longer than the largest
  number commonly named -- a googolplex. And I don't expect to see hard
  disks, let alone files that size until my hair is grey. 2^2040 is the hard
  limit for both addressing and patching.

  This implementation also includes support for IPS patching, as well as the
  NINJA formats, to help ease a few of the IPS die-hards over to the new
  format.

  The PHP implementation is capable of working on any platform which
  supports PHP (currently Windows, Linux, FreeBSD/variant, AmigaOS,
  Mac OS X, Novell NetWare, OS/2, RISC OS, SGI's IRIX, AS/400 and possibly
  QNX).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 LIMITATIONS

  While the format may have virtually none, NINJA implementations may have
  some. For example, this PHP implementation (that includes the EXE version)
  is limited to a max of 32-bit addressing because, as of the current PHP
  version, no variable can hold a quantity higher than 0xffffffff. I hear
  int64 support is coming soon, which would bring the limitations up to
  well over 120GB.

  However, that's just this implementation of the NINJA format. A NINJA
  compatible patcher written in another language (for example, C with asm,
  which could make it as high as 80-bit) could take it further. This is
  really a format designed to grow with computers and languages, because it
  can always expand upward while retaining full backwards compatibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 REQUIREMENTS

  For the executable version, you will need a Windows operating system with
  32-bit executable support (I think this means Windows 95 users are out of
  luck).

  For the PHP version, you will need a system with PHP 4.3.2 or later
  installed. If on a Windows or DOS system, it's recommended you add PHP to
  your $PATH$ Environment Variable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 USAGE

  Run NINJA without any parameters to display the quick help. Modes of
  operation are listed below:

  ninja -p <patch file> <file to patch>
    NINJA will accept any of the NINJA 1.0 formats or the IPS format with
    this command. Your file will be backed up to FILENAME.BAK. After
    patching is complete, you'll be prompted whether to keep or delete the
    file.

  ninja [-t/-tz] <mode> <source file> <modified file> <patch>
    NINJA will create a textual patch of the differences between the
    source and modified files. For mode, specify any of the valid modes
    for NINJA 1.0 (note: not all of them have special functions yet). If
    -tz is used, a gzip compressed patch block will be built.

  ninja [-b/-bz] <mode> <source file> <modified file> <patch>
    NINJA will create a binary patch of the differences between the
    source and modified files. Same rules apply for textual patches. If
    -bz is used, a gzip compressed patch block will be built.
